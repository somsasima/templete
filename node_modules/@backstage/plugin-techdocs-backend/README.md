# techdocs-backend

This is the backend part of the techdocs plugin.

## Getting Started

This backend plugin can be started in a standalone mode from directly in this package
with `yarn start`. However, it will have limited functionality and that process is
most convenient when developing the catalog backend plugin itself.

To evaluate the catalog and have a greater amount of functionality available, instead do

```bash
# in one terminal window, run this from from the very root of the Backstage project
cd packages/backend
yarn start
```
